# Cancer Classification Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to classify cancer categories using machine learning algorithms. The dataset undergoes preprocessing, feature selection, and model training to achieve accurate predictions.

## Dataset
- The dataset obtained from a medical institution for research work, is loaded from an Excel file.
- Categorical variables are encoded using Label Encoding.
- Specific irrelevant or redundant columns are dropped before training.

## Algorithms Used
The following machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling categorical data with encoding.
2. **Feature Selection**: Dropping unnecessary columns.
3. **Splitting the Data**: Train-test split (70-30 ratio).
4. **Model Training**: Training various classification models.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.
6. **Explainable AI**: Implementing techniques to interpret model predictions, including feature importance analysis and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to improve transparency.
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters using Grid Search and Randomized Search.
8. **Deployment Considerations**: Potential deployment strategies using Flask or FastAPI for real-world applications.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the notebook:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn shap
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook step by step to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.

## Explainable AI (XAI)
To ensure model transparency, we use:
- **Feature Importance**: Analyzing which features contribute most to model predictions.
- **SHAP Values**: A method to explain individual predictions.
- **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)**: Generating interpretable explanations for predictions.

## Future Enhancements
- **Deep Learning Models**: Exploring neural networks for improved accuracy.
- **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)**: Implementing AutoML frameworks for automated feature engineering and model selection.
- **Integration with Clinical Data**: Enhancing datasets by integrating real-world clinical data for better generalization.
